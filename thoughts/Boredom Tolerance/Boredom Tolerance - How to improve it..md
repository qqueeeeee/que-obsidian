This is a 3 step process, skipping any of the steps is really bad it's like trying to run a marathon while you can't even jog a mile. So it is not recommended to skip any of these steps, go one after the other. Having a clear roadmap will help you understand where you are and what you're working on and when you're ready to progress and this will remove most of the ambiguity that causes people to either push too hard or not push hard enough. 

### Level 1 - Micro Boredom ### 

_No one's really telling you you're doing great or noticing your progress, You're alone with the work and the work has nothing to say to you._

This level is designed to be almost stupidly easy, you're going to do 1 boring task for 10 to fifteen minutes with no extra stimulation - No music, no podcast, no YouTube video, nothing except you and the task. The task itself doesn't matter much, what matters is the absence of the stimulation. 

The stakes at this level are not any complicated here, you're just teaching your brain that boredom exists and that it's not dangerous and you can sit with it without the world ending. Consistency is the main key here, doing it everyday without skipping matters, 10 minutes a day is much better than 1 hour a week. 

The purpose of level 1 is recalibration, you're resetting your base-line and your base-line expectation for stimulation. Right now your brain probably expects constant  input and anything less than that basically triggers escape behaviors. This is foundational work, it might feel too easy - even if it does, don't skip it, finishing this step matters a lot and actually makes you stick to level two. Most people feel the change in **1-2 weeks** the silence that felt unbearable now feels 

**Progressing**

When the 10 minute task doesn't feel daunting and makes you feel like doing something stimulating constantly, at some point it will natural and maybe even pleasant, when we get there, we are ready to move on to Level 2.

You will also start noticing more ideas coming up, decisions you've been avoiding open-loops that need to be closed as you're only left with you're thoughts and that's the point. This level is basically like a gateway that opens up the path by proving to your nervous system that boredom won't kill you. 

### Level 2 - Single-task work blocks ###

This is the level where you apply boredom tolerance to actual tasks, you set a timer for 30-60 minutes, and you do that task without anything else, no just checking, no glances, nothing. Just the task. The key here is singular focus, it will want to check something else, it will want to do something else, every one of these is a escape attempt and your job is to notice that and stick to the task still, You will feel urges to switch and that's normal and each of the urge is a training opportunity when you feel the pull you stay strong and train yourself.

If you need a break from this, what you can do is, do nothing, until the timer runs our when you get an urge, you can take a break, but that break doesn't mean you do something stimulating, that will once again take away from the whole point of this exercise. You can either just stick to the task or do nothing, anything else breaks it and will just reinforce the bad habits.

Doing nothing works because eventually your brain will get bored of being bored and go back to the task, it's basically a way to use boredom against itself. The timer is also important as having a defined end-point will make the discomfort more tolerable because you know it's temporary. 
Like [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]] says in one of her books, "A human can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight." or like [[Viktor Frankl]] said "Pain is only bearable if we know it will end."

After the timer ends, STOP, even if you want to keep going as you're in focus, but stop, because it's better to stop as you will learn to trust yourself that you're gonna stop when you say you will. This makes it easier for your brain to trust your timer which will make it better for next time.

**Progression** 

When 30 minute feels very easy increase it to 45, then 60 then 75 and then finally 90, when you can easily do it up-to 90 minutes, you're ready to keep going to the next level.

### Level 3 - Repetition without Novelty ###

You're going to do the same task, with the same time, day after day, no variation, no mixing it up for the stake of variety, you're going to stick with one over and over again. You're deliberately removing novelty from the equation as it's a crutch your brain uses to get you avoid actual boredom tolerance so when you can get yourself to do something for weeks without needing to change it up, you've reached a new level of tolerance that most people never do. This can be something like writing in the morning, or exercising, anything, doing one thing at the same time everyday regardless of the results. The same-ness is the point, this will feel boring, that is the point. If it feels repetitive then you're doing it right. In-fact boredom at this level is a signal of mastery, you're training your capacity to train without novelty it means you stripped away all dopamine sources and you're still showing up. 

This level is also about consistency, everyone can do it once, or a week, you need to do this, for weeks, months, years in-fact, the point is, you keep going even though there's no result. This is what keeps successful people at the top, the YouTuber who posts everyday for 2 years with no growth, the guy who goes to the gym for months without seeing any physical progress, this is what separates people. Consistency is key. **Everything valuable requires compounding and compounding requires time and time requires sustained effort without novelty.**  

**Making boredom work for you**

Boredom tolerance is basically a multiplier on all that you do, you work, your skills, your projects, all of it works better when you can actually stay in action for things to actually compound. So the  people who build health, wealth, success aren't doing anything crazy, they're just doing the obvious things longer than everyone else and time is the multiplier that most people can't access because they can't tolerate the boredom to let the time work, compounding needs time. The magic of compounding is invisible in the early stages that's why most people quit. The first year of almost anything looks almost unimpressive and the year two builds on your one, year three builds on your three, eventually curve goes exponential. 

**Durability beats intensity almost everytime.** - The person who can show up at 70% efforts for years beats the person who can show up at 100% efforts for weeks.
