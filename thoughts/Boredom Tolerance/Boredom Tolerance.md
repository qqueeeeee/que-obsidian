### Overview ###

First off, if any of this happened to you, congrats, you're normal, I mean it happened to me, that's why I'm spending my time understanding and fixing it - in fact, writing this so that I remind myself and actually work on it to improve myself.

Boredom tolerance refers to the process of tolerating something even when the task is mundane and boring, people might assume they don't do stuff because of lack of discipline and motivation or something else but the root cause of all of that usually stems from lack of Boredom Tolerance. 

### Why boredom is the real bottleneck to success

All tasks usually need you to do consistent practice for a fairly long time for you to be good at them, regardless of if its gaming or programming or anything in-general. Here's where boredom comes into place, when you do tasks for this long, you're bound to get bored, it's not if or will, it's when. You WILL get bored of it one day or the other even thought it might not be a permanent thing and you might come back to it but you will get bored of it eventually or tired of it. Now this is where boredom tolerance helps.

### How does boredom work anyways - why do you get bored?

It's not actually a person's fault on why they get bored, it's more of a nervous system thing, and it's pretty simple, when you start a task you're usually pretty bad at it, and simple changes and simple things yield massive progress and your brain loves it and it's referred to as a "honey-moon" phase for your [[dopamine]] system as it's so stimulated even by little things. 

So, our brain gets used to this constant stimulation even through simple tasks which of course as time goes back reduces and your brain doesn't like as it's used to the high constant stimulation. This is where boredom comes into place and this phase is called the [[Flat Phase]] as there is no a flatline of dopamine compared to our previous spikes. This is also ties right into the [[quick feedback]] and [[invisible progress]] aspects of tasks, as this is where most people quit.
	*It's like watching grass grow, the growth is there but you can't see it day-to-day which makes it finally nothing is actually working.*

The second phase is the [[Escape Phase]] this is where people usually pivot from this and go for something else, this doesn't have to be obvious like scrolling your phone or some other kind of thing, in-fact it's usually much more "productive looking" - what this means is you don't have to pivot into something that wastes your time you could also do something like re-organizing your desk or re-adjusting your time table, now don't get me wrong it's not like they are always worthless, it's just that your more often than not doing those things while escaping from one of the tasks you find boring. It's just that none of the task you're doing as an escape really does anything for the task you're actually planning to do/doing. This is just an escape from it. This also ties perfectly to [[Shiny Object Syndrome]] where people often pivot from one thing to another "Shiny" looking thing because they find it more interesting. This concept is pretty similar and often a huge reason for that. 

Often the result lies right after the [[Flat Phase]] so by quitting at that time, we're just losing out on the result we worked all this time previous to that for which is truly sad to think about. 

### Good news - It is fixable ###

As bad and harmful it is, this pattern is indeed fixable, as like everything, if it's predictable, it's preventable, Fixing it goes along with understanding and actually seeing the pattern. Before we go with how to fix let's preface by noting some things, **Sustainable beats intense here, Your nervous system needs consistent repeated signals to change and consistency requires a difficulty level that you can actually stick with.** So each time you're surviving a boredom exposure you're sending your system a signal that this is survivable and that signal accumulates over time and the adaptation happens quietly in the background and one day you notice that one day the things you used to find unbearable now feel fine. 

To fix it we're going to make a three-level system that will improve our boredom tolerance.
