This will be my project for the upcoming few days, I want to work on this as it not only improves my resume but also improves my skills and helps me improve my day-to-day life. 


### Requirements 

 - Daily logging of tasks done - (can be through google docs or something else undecided still)
 - Store the logged data locally, no cloud storage, for now.
 - Simple interactive LLM chat, it should be able to talk to us about our day, what we might've missed from the previous day, or how we can improve our current day.
 - [[RAG]] on notes: Feed my notes to it so that it develops an even better understanding of me. 
 - Simple modern looking UI - current idea to use [[Tauri]] + [[Python]] as I hate web-apps and want actual good desktop apps.
 - Start with some cloud LLM but eventually add a picker/option to switch between a cloud LLM or a installed LLM if the user wishes to do so.
